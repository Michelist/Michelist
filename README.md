- 👋 Hi, I’m @Michelist
- 👀 I’m interested in all and nothing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use a graphics software called Krita. It's hard for me to learn because I'm severe learning-disabled through the effects of some more or less severe strokes. But I'm alive and that counts!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  ... I'll see, actually there is no plan. But I'll share my ideas. I'm good at having good ideas. Ideas others can trust in and build upon.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Perhaps the mail I've registered with, PM or something like that? I`ll see which ways GitHub offers, I registered minutes ago...
